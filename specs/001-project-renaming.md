# SPEC: Project Rebranding (Ralph Sandbox Swarm)

**Objective:** Transition the entire project identity from `sprites-swarm` to `ralph-sandbox-swarm`.

## Phase 1: The Cloud Strike (GitHub Rename)
- [ ] Execute `gh repo rename ralph-sandbox-swarm`.
- [ ] Verify GitHub remote URL updates to `git@github.com:ianchanning/ralph-sandbox-swarm.git`.

## Phase 2: The Physical Shift (Local Rename) [MANUAL]
- [ ] Rename host directory from `~/Projects/sprites` to `~/Projects/ralph-sandbox-swarm`.
- [ ] Re-orient brain context to the new path.

## Phase 3: The Final Link (Persistence)
- [ ] Update `progress.txt` with the successful renaming.
- [ ] Verify `lsprite.sh` and `ralph.sh` still operate correctly in the new path.
- [ ] Final commit and push to the new remote.
